                                        <p>The priority task of web hosting is to locate websites on different servers and to provide
                                            access to them through the Internet. Every year the number of firms that provide
                                            services for <span>web hosting</span> increases. Such firms are hosting providers. Among the main
                                            services are the following: provision of space on the server; selection of the Internet
                                            channel of the required width; the possibility of placing servers of different companies;
                                            co-location, better known as colocation.

                                            <br>
                                            In terms of their capabilities, these services can have many fundamental differences
                                            between themselves. Let's look at how they manifest themselves. The easiest way to
                                            place "single-page sites", which are downloaded using the FTP protocol. In such a file,
                                            the servers will be saved unchanged. In this service, some companies can provide
                                            <span>hosting</span> for their customers for free. Servicing of personal sites can often be ordered at
                                            an inexpensive price. Companies sometimes practice hosting this kind of hosting for
                                            free, but they expose their terms. For example, for advertising on the site. But the <span>cost</span>
                                            of hosting for commercial sites is more expensive, since large sites and large Internet
                                            portals can not do without providing a whole list of additional services. The basis of
                                            these services is the development platform and their location. These include PHP, Java
                                            and many other platforms.

                                            <br>
                                            The list of works carried out by the company includes the creation of a control panel.
                                            With its help, you manage both the site and the server. In addition, web services are
                                            installed through the control panel. In many cases, hosting providers specialize in
                                            e-commerce. These services are needed by large customers who hire companies
                                            to perform tasks related to technical work on the network.</p>

                                        <p>Hosting is the main part of the services provided by the Internet provider. First, you need
                                            to calculate the amount of resources that the site will need. Particular attention should be
                                            paid to the degree of software need (to implement scripting languages). Also, you need

                                            to calculate the amount of resources that the site will need. Particular attention should be
                                            paid to the degree of software need (to implement scripting languages).

                                        <p>A virtual private server is located on a powerful physical server. The VPS owner gains
                                            full control over the virtual server. The virtual server has the ability to move from one
                                            server to another. The task of this hosting is to share the server resources so that they

                                        <p>The priority task of web hosting is to locate websites on different servers and to provide
                                            access to them through the Internet. Every year the number of firms that provide
                                            services for <span>web hosting</span> increases. Such firms are hosting providers. Among the main
                                            services are the following: provision of space on the server; selection of the Internet
                                            channel of the required width; the possibility of placing servers of different companies;
                                            co-location, better known as colocation.

                                            <br>
                                            In terms of their capabilities, these services can have many fundamental differences
                                            between themselves. Let's look at how they manifest themselves. The easiest way to
                                            place "single-page sites", which are downloaded using the FTP protocol. In such a file,
                                            the servers will be saved unchanged. In this service, some companies can provide
                                            <span>hosting</span> for their customers for free. Servicing of personal sites can often be ordered at
                                            an inexpensive price. Companies sometimes practice hosting this kind of hosting for
                                            free, but they expose their terms. For example, for advertising on the site. But the <span>cost</span>
                                            of hosting for commercial sites is more expensive, since large sites and large Internet
                                            portals can not do without providing a whole list of additional services. The basis of
                                            these services is the development platform and their location. These include PHP, Java
                                            and many other platforms.

                                            The list of works carried out by the company includes the creation of a control panel.
                                            With its help, you manage both the site and the server. In addition, web services are
                                            installed through the control panel. In many cases, hosting providers specialize in
                                            e-commerce. These services are needed by large customers who hire companies
                                            to perform tasks related to technical work on the network.</p>

                                        <p>The priority task of web hosting is to locate websites on different servers and to provide
                                            access to them through the Internet. Every year the number of firms that provide
                                            services for <span>web hosting</span> increases. Such firms are hosting providers. Among the main
                                            services are the following: provision of space on the server; selection of the Internet
                                            channel of the required width; the possibility of placing servers of different companies;
                                            co-location, better known as colocation.

                                            <br>
                                            In terms of their capabilities, these services can have many fundamental differences
                                            between themselves. Let's look at how they manifest themselves. The easiest way to
                                            place "single-page sites", which are downloaded using the FTP protocol. In such a file,
                                            the servers will be saved unchanged. In this service, some companies can provide
                                            <span>hosting</span> for their customers for free. Servicing of personal sites can often be ordered at
                                            an inexpensive price. Companies sometimes practice hosting this kind of hosting for
                                            free, but they expose their terms. For example, for advertising on the site. But the <span>cost</span>
                                            of hosting for commercial sites is more expensive, since large sites and large Internet
                                            portals can not do without providing a whole list of additional services. The basis of
                                            these services is the development platform and their location. These include PHP, Java
                                            and many other platforms.

                                            The list of works carried out by the company includes the creation of a control panel.
                                            With its help, you manage both the site and the server. In addition, web services are
                                            installed through the control panel. In many cases, hosting providers specialize in
                                            e-commerce. These services are needed by large customers who hire companies
                                            to perform tasks related to technical work on the network.</p>
